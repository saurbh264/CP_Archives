-A  can't be a divisor of B if A>B.

-Note that (a1⊕x)⊕(a2⊕x)⊕...equals a1⊕a2⊕…⊕an if n is even, or a1⊕a2⊕…⊕an⊕x if n is odd. 
Then, if the length of the array is odd, you must print ⊕ of the whole array. 
And if the length is even, we can't change the value of the expression with our operation. It turns out that if ⊕
of the whole array is 0, we can output any number, but otherwise there is no answer.

- In case of parity problems try to convert them into zeroes and ones.
