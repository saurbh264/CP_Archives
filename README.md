# CP_Archives

Welcome to my Competitive Programming (CP) Archives! üèÜ

This repository is a collection of solutions to problems I've solved during my journey in Competitive Programming. As a newbie in CP, I'm using this space to document my progress, learn from my mistakes, and share my solutions with the community.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **TLE Eliminator Sheet**: A curated set of problems across different ratings aimed at improving my problem-solving skills and eliminating those dreaded Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) errors.
   - Each Rating Problems has its own folder.
   - Folders are named according to the Rating.
   - Inside each folder, you'll find:
     - `solution.cpp` (or other relevant language files): The code that solves the problem.

2. **Contests**: Contains solutions to problems attempted during various contests.
   - Each contest has its own folder.
   - Folders are named according to the contest name or platform.
   - Inside each folder, you'll find:
     - `problemX.cpp`: Solution to the Xth problem in the contest.

## Progress

I'm still in the early stages of CP, so my solutions may not always be the most optimized or elegant. However, I'm committed to improving my skills with every problem and contest I attempt.


## Acknowledgements

A big thanks to the CP community and all the resources that have helped me so far. I'm looking forward to contributing more as I progress.

Happy Coding! üöÄ
